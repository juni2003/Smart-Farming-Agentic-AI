- **Framework**: Flask + Flask-CORS
- **Port**: 5000
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `POST /api/crop/recommend` - Crop recommendation
  - `POST /api/disease/predict` - Disease detection (upload image)
  - `POST /api/qa` - Farming Q&A
  - `GET /api/system/info` - System information

### Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS) ✓
- **Location**: `c:\Users\LAPTOP CLINIC\Documents\Projects\smart-farming-advisor\frontend\`
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Green & Yellow theme)
- **Port**: 3000
- **Pages**:
  1. **Home** (`/`) - Landing page with features
  2. **About** (`/about`) - Project details
  3. **Crop Advisor** (`/crop`) - Crop recommendation tool
  4. **Disease Detection** (`/disease`) - Plant disease identifier
  5. **Farming Q&A** (`/qa`) - Ask farming questions
  6. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Results dashboard
  7. **Models Info** (`/models`) - Model metrics
  8. **Contact** (`/contact`) - Feedback form

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN

### STEP 1: Start Backend Server

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\LAPTOP CLINIC\Documents\Projects\smart-farming-advisor"
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
🚀 STARTING SMART FARMING ADVISOR API
✅ API server starting on http://localhost:5000
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

---

### STEP 2: Start Frontend

Open a **NEW** terminal and run:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\LAPTOP CLINIC\Documents\Projects\smart-farming-advisor\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

---

### STEP 3: Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:3000**

---

## 🎨 DESIGN THEME

**Colors:**
- Primary Green: `#22c55e` (for nature/farming)
- Secondary Yellow: `#fbbf24` (for sun/crops)
- Background: Gradient from green to yellow
- Glass effect cards with backdrop blur

**UI Features:**
- Modern, clean design
- Responsive (works on mobile)
- Smooth transitions
- Icons and emojis for visual appeal

## 🧪 TESTING THE SYSTEM

### Test 1: Crop Recommendation
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/crop
2. Enter values:
   - N: 90
   - P: 42
   - K: 43
   - Temperature: 20
   - Humidity: 82
   - pH: 6.5
   - Rainfall: 202
3. Click "Get Recommendation"
4. Should see recommended crop with confidence score

### Test 2: Disease Detection
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/disease
2. Upload a plant leaf image
3. Click "Detect Disease"
4. Should see disease prediction with confidence

### Test 3: Farming Q&A
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/qa
2. Ask: "What is the best time to plant rice?"
3. Should get relevant answer from knowledge base

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Backend won't start?
1. Check Python is installed: `python --version`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check if models exist in `models/` directory

### Frontend won't start?
1. Check Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Install dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
3. Check if port 3000 is available

### Can't connect frontend to backend?
1. Make sure backend is running on port 5000
2. Check `.env` file has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`
3. Look for CORS errors in browser console

## 📊 MODELS PERFORMANCE

| Model | Type | Accuracy |
|-------|------|----------|
| Crop Recommendation | Random Forest | 99.39% |
| Disease Detection | ResNet50 | 98.97% |
| RAG Q&A | FAISS + Transformers | 100% Hit Rate |

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test all features** from the browser
2. **Customize the UI** colors/images as needed
3. **Add your own data** to improve models
4. **Deploy** to cloud (Vercel for frontend, Python hosting for backend)
